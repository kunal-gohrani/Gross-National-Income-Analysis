# Gross-National-Income-Analysis
 In this project, I, along with my team, have done an analysis with the the data of GNI per capita of each country from 1962 to 2014. The aim of the analysis was to find out:-
 - Top 15 countries having high GNI per capita in 1962 and 2014
 - Top 15 countries having low GNI per capita in 1962 and 2014
 - After finding out the list of countries from above 2 aims, I found out countries which have consistently been in the top 15 lists of having high/low GNI per capita. The method for finding out this was to match the list of top 15 high/low GNI  countries in 1962 and 2014 and check whether the country is still in top 15 list in both the years.
